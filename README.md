# AutoKickOnDeath
WoW Classic Hardcore Addon that makes it easier to remove players that died from guild.
#How to use:
  Install addon, either by using curseforge or manually dropping the "AutoKickOnDeath" folder into your " WoW Classic Era / Interface / AddOns / " Directory.  Once installed, upon loading, the addon will create a macro called..
  "MyGuildKickMacro".  After the addon has created the macro you will MANUALLY have to pull the macro from your macro tab /Macros and place it somewhere on your action bars.  The addon will parse system messages for a death alert,
  when a player death is detected it will create a small pop up below the minimap reminding you of the death for 10 seconds.  Once you see this alert you can simply press the macro and it will remove the player that died.
